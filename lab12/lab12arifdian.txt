I created a class called hashSearch. I created a textfile called text.txt containing
the link of the paragraph that needs to be processed.

I used while loop to check if every line is empty and for every line checks if
the word algorithm or data is present.

if the target word is present add the line number to linkedlist defined in hash,
else nothing is added.

After the hash table is filled out completely with regards to completely reading the 
text.txt file.

check if the hash table contains the target word(key), if it is, print the line number list which 
is the values with respect to the key. else, print the word is not found in the file.

this is the output I obtain.
Word algorithm is not found in this document.
Word data is found on lines: [3, 5, 6, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19]
