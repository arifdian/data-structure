I created an interface called CardSet.java which contains methods like
initialize and drawRandomCard. I then created MyCardset.java which has 
a constructor for deck, rank and suits. I created the method referred 
from the interface. this is my output:
3D
JH
AH

For part b, I created a Tweet class which had constructor of author and content.
I also created 2 method called contains and print. this is my output:
lalal
heifuwgerurhoruhg
ajex
hehehehehhe
baba
lololololol

For both part, I fail to call them inside the MyGLsurfaceview because my emulator somehow
stops running today. It just takes too long to load. However, I tested it with main method and
it works fine to give those output above.
