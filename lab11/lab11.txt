For flood it game, there are 2 suggested solution recursive and non-recursive.
the first method that I attempted uses non-recursive method by using while
loop and for loop. During the while and for loop, the color is assumed
to be stored in a list and comparison is made every loop, but the difference 
is that in for loop it is iterrative and in while loop it is not. With, these
being said for loop is less convenient sue to the fact that it is iterrative
and when working with linkedlist adding and copying from the list at the same
time is not possible. However, back to the question again, recursive can also 
be done in iterrative manner. The recursive function is to exhaust all the 
possible boundaries which is up, down, left and right. The recursive style 
will be slightly faster due to the fact that no memory needs to be recalled
and it has a solid base case to function instead of looping for all different
possibilities.
