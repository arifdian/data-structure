I and wang jiebo have started working since yesterday. Since we are not
too sure of the topological sort that we did in hw8. We had been trying our 
best since 4pm today and it has been 7 hours. we finally manage to work 
together to get our topological order correctly. we also attempted to get
the weight of our node to node connection based on the txt file given.
our plan is to add the weight to our nodes as we go through the path and
for each respective path compare the total weight and get the most and
it's path. Too bad, we fail to get the longest path after several hours after
debugging. However, we get each weight of the node. In terms of work, Arif
does more on testing code and giving some idea while Jiebo create code and 
also contribute to different ideas.I hope for your leniency and understanding 
that this homework is challenging compared to others.
