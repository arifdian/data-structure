HW7

A) In order to find the minimum value in the list given, given a sorting the
list at first, would be located at the first index [0] of the list. the time
complexity would be big-O 0f c where c is a constant.

B) In order to find the maximum value in the list, given sorting the list at 
first with ascending order, the maximum would be located at the last index of 
the list which is [length-1]. the time complexity would be big-theta of 
[length-1] or big-O of c where c is a constant.

C) In order to compute for the mean, the sorting of the list does not matter.
Hence sorted or unsorted does not change the time complexity because it is
about the sum and the total number of elements. Therefore, you need to get 
every element in the list and the time complexity for that is big-O of n.

D) In order to find the median, given that we have to sort the list first,
the middle value would depend if the length of the list is even or odd. In
case it's odd, the median would be located at (length+1)/2. In case, it's even
, the median would be located at length/2 and length/2 + 1. Hence, the time
complexity would be big-O of nlogn because we need to sort the list.

E) In order to find the mode, given that we have to sort the list first, we 
have to got through the list and compare the element with another element next
to it. the time complexity of going through the list takes big-O of n.
