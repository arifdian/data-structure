I am given BinNode class, HuffTree class and MinHeap class. My task is to implement a build code method
that would traverse to the Huff tree to find a leaf node that has a value of an alphabet. The key for the 
given alphabet is made up of the path that you traverse in order to get the leaf node. every left traverse 
is coded by "0" and every right traverse is coded by "1". I understand how to insert a leaf node and it's
code into dictionary using put() method. However, I failed to repeat the steps for another leaf node /
consecutive leaf node. I have been trying to figure out ways using loops or while for 5 hours but unfortunately,
I did not get the encoded message which uses the buildCodeTable method defined. I only managed to get the helper
function buildCode() completed. I get to the decoding method successfully as it prints out the 
message = 0110111111011001110111101 decodes into ELMDUCK.
