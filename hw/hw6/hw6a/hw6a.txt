I created a class called editham.java which has a scanner for reading input
of DNA of strings. I tried to import fileReader to read txt file but to no
avail. I created a hamDNA method to calculate the hamming distance and created
editDNA to calculate the edit distance between 2 DNA. I use 2 dimensional array
to store my counting and use a couple of for loops to go through both list one
at a time. I instatiated my method in main and and print out the result:

1st dna: 
ATCGGCTAGGCTGATTCAGA
2nd dna: 
TATTTTCCCCGGGAAATTTT

       
ATCGGCTAGGCTGATTCAGA
TATTTTCCCCGGGAAATTTT
       
Hamming distance: 18
edit distance: 14
