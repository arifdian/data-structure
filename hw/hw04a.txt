Exercise 5.14
you will lose the average case run time  theta of (log n) because we need to search to
over the whole part of trees (n times) which defeats the purpose of the tree. 
because it has the same time complexity of a list big-o of n.

Exercise 5.15 a
15   15    15       15     15      15       15
      \     \        \      \      / \    /    \
      20    20       20     20    5  20  5     20
	     \       / \    / \     / \   \    / \
	     25     18 25  18 25   18 25   7  18  25
	                   /       /          /
	                  16      16         16

Exercise 5.15 b
Pre-order : 15-5-7-20-18-16-25
In-order  : 5-7-15-16-18-20-25
Post-order: 7-5-16-18-25-20-15

Exercise 5.24
In a max heap, the parent is always greater or equal to its children. 
therefore, the smallest element must be a leaf.

Exercise 5.32
a) Inserting into normal array(5) will make the array sorted.
Since, we are inserting the values in sorted order which takes O(1)
The array is already sorted hence making the time complexity
down to  O(log n). ANS = 5

b) Since the searches are very minimal(as less as 10). it is possible for up to O(n) 
for searching but this results in large insertions. it takes O(log n) for insertion 
array based list of unsorted records takes O(1) time per insertion and O(n) time per search. ANS = 5

c) number of insertions and searches are equal, it would be best if both of these 
operations takes O(log n) rather than operations taking O(n). log n grows faster 
than n. hence, BST would be the best option. ANS = 3

d) number of searches is a million best one to use is binary search (O(log n)), 
that is 3 and 4 by considering the insertion. for sorted array, it requires O(n) 
for insertion while bst requires only O(log n).ANS = 3.


Written Excercise:
  	         
A = 0    (1)
G = 1 0  (2)
T = 1 1 0(3)
C = 1 1 1(3)	

for a DNA sequence the fixd-length encoding it takes 2N bits
uncompressed size = 2N	
A: 50% N * 1 = 0.5N
G: 35% N * 2 = 0.7N
T: 10% N * 3 = 0.3N
C: 5%  N * 3 = 0.15N
compressed size = 0.5N + 0.7N + 0.3N + 0.15N = 1.65N
compressed ratio = 2/1.65 = 1.212
