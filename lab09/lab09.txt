Lab09

Today, the lab is about figuring the kth smallest element in a sorted BST. In which I created a method called 
select where I used recursion to traverse through the sorted tree. I am successful in getting 2nd and 3rd smallest
but I failed to get the ends 1st for some reason. I have tried debugging for 5 hours but to no avail.
this is the result i get:
37(7) 24(3) 7(2) 2(1) 42(3) 40(1) 120(1) 
1
3rd smallest = 24
kth value not found in tree
