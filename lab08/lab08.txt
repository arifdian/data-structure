I create a find method in BinNodeJr class and implement it in the main method and give this result:
I used recursion method to recurse through the left and right of the tree defined.
40 is found in the tree: true
100 is found in the tree: false
70 is found in the tree: true

I create checkBalance method with the helper method of treeHeight and checkBalance2.
the reason I create checkBalance2 is because in order to recurse through all possibilities
in the tree, you have to have a boolean as argument. checkBalance is just a method to print
out unbalanced or balanced message. This is my test result:

Preorder enumeration: key(size-of-the-subtree)
37(7) 24(3) 7(2) 2(1) 42(3) 40(1) 120(1) 
Unbalanced
